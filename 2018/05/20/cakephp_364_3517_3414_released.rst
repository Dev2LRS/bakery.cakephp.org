CakePHP 3.6.4, 3.5.17, 3.4.14 Released
======================================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
3.6.4. This is a maintenance release for the 3.6 branch that fixes several
community reported issues.

We are also releasing 3.5.17 and 3.4.14 at this time. These releases contain
security related fixes that address a cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability
in the development only 'missing route' and 'duplicate named route' error pages.
We recommend that all users of 3.4 and 3.5 update to these releases.
