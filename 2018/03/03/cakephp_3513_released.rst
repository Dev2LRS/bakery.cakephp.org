CakePHP 3.5.13 Released
=======================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP 3.5.13. This is a maintenance release for the 3.5 branch that fixes several community reported issues.

Bugfixes & New Features
-----------------------

You can expect the following changes in 3.5.13. See the [changelog](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/3.5.12...3.5.13) for every commit.

* ``Form`` now allows schema classes to be customized via the ``_schemaClass`` property.
* A notice error in the missing template error page was fixed.
* Tables with no primary key can no longer be updated by the ORM. Instead of a dangerous update operation an exception will be raised.
* Entity virtual fields are now included in debug output.
* PaginatorComponent no longer prefixes sort fields. This makes defining ``sortWhitelist`` easier.
* Improved API documentation.
* Session configuration in integration test cases should not emit errors in PHP7.2 with database sessions.
* ``FormHelper`` now accepts ``multiple => false`` to disable multi-select generation.
