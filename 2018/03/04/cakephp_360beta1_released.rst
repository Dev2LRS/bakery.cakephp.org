CakePHP 3.6.0-beta1 Released
============================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
3.6.0-beta1. This is the first beta release for 3.6.0, and it contains several
new major features.

Updating to the beta
--------------------

You can use composer to upgrade to the beta version of CakePHP 3.6.0::

    php composer.phar require --update-with-dependencies "cakephp/cakephp:3.6.0-beta1"

We would greatly appreciate it if you temporarily upgraded your application,
and ran your tests. By opening issues for any regressions in the beta, we can
help ensure a smoother release of 3.6.0 before the stable release.

What's new in 3.6.0?
--------------------

The `migration guide
<https://book.cakephp.org/3.next/en/appendices/3-6-migration-guide.html>`_ has
a complete list of what's new in 3.6.0, and what has been deprecated. We
recommend you give that page a read when upgrading.
