CakePHP 3.4.8 Released
======================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
3.4.8. This is a maintenance release for the 3.4 branch that fixes several
community reported issues.

Bugfixes & New Features
-----------------------

You can expect the following changes in 3.4.8. See the `changelog
<https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/3.4.7...3.4.8>`_ for every commit.

* Improved composer keywords for sub-split packages.
* ``BelongsToMany::link()`` now persist multiple operations correctly.
* Improved API documentation.
* PO file parsing correctly parses messages when the same message key is defined
  with a context and without contexts. This changes the internal data
  representation of translated messages, you should take care to clear your i18n
  cache data when upgrading.
* ``ValidationRule`` no longer raises an unpack error when parameters are an
  associative array.
* ``RouteBuilder::prefix()`` now supports a ``path`` option which allows you to
  customize the path segment used for prefix routing scopes.
* Logging will now log the JSON encoded version of entities. Furthermore,
  ``JsonSerializable`` instances that are logged will not encode Unicode data.
* Paginated queries that use ``matching()`` calls inside other ``matching()``
  calls no longer emit invalid SQL.
* Autolinking better handles URLs generated by AngularJS.
* ``Mailer`` correctly proxies the ``getX`` methods on ``Email``.
* ``Database\Query::clause()`` now raises exceptions when reading unknown
  clauses.
* ``RedisEngine::add()`` now uses ``setTimeout()`` to set the TTL, instead of
  writing the key twice.
* ``RedisEngine::increment()`` and ``decrement()`` now set the engine's TTL on
  counters. This makes redis counters have consistent behavior with Memcached
  counters.
* ISO8601 datetimes that use the 'Z' timezone are parsed correctly now.
* ``ProgressHelper::init()``, ``draw()`` and ``increment()`` now return
  ``$this``.
* MySQL schema reflection no longer forces primary key columns to be be
  auto-incrementing when autoIncrement was explicitly disabled.
* ``FormHelper::radio()`` now handles disabled attribute generation when radio
  options are defined with the complex form, and only a subset of radio options
  have been disabled.
* ``TableHelper::output()`` no longer requires all rows to have the same keys.
