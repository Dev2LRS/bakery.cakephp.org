Welcoming Phinx to the CakePHP family!
======================================

We are very excited to announce that Phinx has joined the CakePHP team. The
Github project has already been moved to the CakePHP organisation. The project
itself will stay MIT-licensed but be gradually transformed into a Cake Software
Foundation project. Other great news is that the current way to install and
update Phinx remains unchanged.

As you are aware, CakePHP has been using Phinx since 3.0.0 for database
migrations. The CakePHP Core team welcomes the opportunity to look after and
maintain the project and will now start making changes to bring the code in line
with the CakePHP (our) coding standards. As well as cleaning up issues and PR's
soon. We will be following up with our plans for the code and setting roadmaps
in the coming weeks.

We welcome Phinx to the CakePHP family and hope to see Rob Morgan, Richard
Quadling, Woody Gilk around!
