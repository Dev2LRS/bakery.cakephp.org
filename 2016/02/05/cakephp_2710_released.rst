You can expect the following changes in 2.7.10. See the `changelog
<http://cakephp.org/changelogs/2.7.10>`_ for every commit.

* Improved API docs. (@ndm2)
* The ``IN`` operator now works in conditions when only one element is to be
  matched. (@pedrofs)
* Support for ``NOT IN`` added for ``Model::find()`` conditions. This makes 2.x
  finders more compatible with 3.x (@pedrofs)
* ``cake i18n extract`` now behaves better when CakePHP is installed with
  composer. (@garas)
* ``Configure::load()`` can now read symlinked configuration files (@tersmitten)
