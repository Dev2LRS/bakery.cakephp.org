CakePHP 2.8.3, 3.0.18, 3.1.13 and 3.2.6 Released
================================================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
2.8.3, 3.0.18, 3.1.13, and 3.2.6. These releases contain security
fixes. 3.2.6 and 2.8.3 also contain bugfixes.

Security Fixes
--------------

These releases fix a weakness in ``Validation::uploadedFile()`` where file
inputs could be manipulated to accept existing files on the server. This could
potentially lead to an attacker being able to access sensitive system files. If
you are using ``Validation::uploadedFile()`` and not checking mime-types or
ensuring that the file was in-fact an uploaded file, you should upgrade. We'd
like to thank Kurita Takashi for reporting this issue.

Bugfixes in 2.8.3
-----------------

* Improved API docs. (@ravage84)
* Boolean ``false`` is now treated as ``0`` when creating selectboxes. This
  allows select widgets to be used for boolean columns. (@markstory)
* Optimized nested association loading. (@tharlinsmith)
* ``ControllerTestCase::testAction()`` now clears the request stack after each
  call. This fixes issues where multiple calls to testAction() could not be done
  in the same test method when using array URLs. (@markstory)

Bugfixes in 3.2.6
-----------------

* Improved API documentation (@Sethathi, @thinkingmedia)
* Queries generated by the marshaller now correctly alias primary key columns.
  (@markstory)
* Complex conditions in BelongsToMany associations now work correctly.
  (@markstory)
* Select box widgets for boolean values now generate correctly. ``false`` is now
  treated as equivalent to 0. (@markstory)
* ``Http\Client`` now supports ``ssl_verify_peer_name`` option correctly now.
  (@curtisgibby)
* CakePHP can now be used from within a phar file. (@lorenzo)
* Bound parameters in sub-queries now propagate to their parent query.
  (@markstory)
* A regression in the Postgres schema reflection code has been corrected.
  (@markstory)
* Accessing TitleCase properties from entities now works as expected. (@dakota)
* Cells in sub-namespaces now work as one would expect. (@markstory)
* '' is now a valid value for time inputs. (@markstory)

New Features in 3.2.6
---------------------

* ``Cake\ORM\Marshaller::one()`` now supports a ``forceNew`` option that can be
  used to create 'new' belongsToMany association records when the primary key is
  not defined. (@Tzaoh)
* ``SecurityComponent`` now emits helpful error messages when secure field
  comparisons fail and an application is in debug mode. (@steinkel)
* ``Validation::localizedTime()`` was added. (@ypnos-web)
* Error logs contain request URL and referrer URLs. (@mirko-paglial)

As always, a huge thanks to all the community members that helped make this
release happen by reporting issues and sending pull requests.
