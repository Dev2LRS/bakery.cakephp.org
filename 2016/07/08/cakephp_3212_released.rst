The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP 3.2.12. This is a maintenance release for the 3.2 branch that fixes several community reported issues and adds a few minor features.

Bugfixes
--------

You can expect the following changes in 3.2.12. See the [changelog](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/3.2.11...3.2.12) for changes.

* The console ``TableHelper`` more gracefully handles empty data.  (@thinkingmedia)
* Junction table conditions are now reset correctly. (@ulistaerk)
* ExistsIn and IsUnique application rules are no longer invoked twice. (@markstory)
* Generated junction table classes now inherit the connection of the table defining the BelongsToMany association. This makes it easier to have plugin specific connections. (@markstory)
* URLs with uppercase protocols are now autolinked by ``TextHelper``. (@ADmad)
* Cache groups defined in injected cache engine instances are now registered correctly. (@dakota)
* ``Request::header()`` can now read the ``Content-Length`` and ``Content-Type`` header values. (@markstory)

Minor Enhancements
------------------

* Schema reflection will now include per-column collation data when available.  (@chinpei215)
* ``TimeHelper`` now supports an ``outputTimezone`` config option. This lets you set a global output timezone making it easier to localise formatted dates/times. (@markstory)
* ``HtmlHelper::image()`` now supports ``CID:`` URLs. (@markstory)
* ``Table::findOrCreate()`` now supports an ``atomic`` option. (@thinkingmedia)
* Performance optimizations in ``find(list)`` (@dakota)
* ``Folder::inCakePath()`` is now deprecated. Use ``Folder::inPath()`` instead.  (@markstory)

As always, a huge thanks to all the community members that helped make this release happen by reporting issues and sending pull requests.
