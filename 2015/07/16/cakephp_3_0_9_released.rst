CakePHP 3.0.9 Released
======================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
3.0.9. This is a maintenance release for the 3.0 branch.

Bugfixes
--------

You can expect the following changes in 3.0.9. See the `changelog
<https://cakephp.org/changelogs/3.0.9>`_ for every commit.

* Index and constraint reflection in MySQL now scopes to the current database.
* ``.`` is now allowed in ObjectRegistry keys. This allows cache configurations
  to have ``.`` in their names.
* Datetime validation now correctly handles meridian values.
* Improved API documentation.
* Pagination link generation is correct with custom routes.
* ``Entity::extractOriginalChanged()`` now returns properties that were initially
  null.
* Marshalling ``_joinData`` in belongsToMany associations with existing entities
  is now handled correctly.
* ``Text::tokenize()`` now works as expected when the separator is a multi-byte
  character.
* Folders generated by ``i18n extract`` have the correct permissions assigned.
* Entities are now marked as 'clean' after the afterSave event.
* The ORM does not emit UPDATE statements for hasMany and belongsToMany
  associations that have not actually changed.
* ``Response::file()`` now accepts files with ``..`` in the basename.

Improvements
------------

As part of the 3.0 patch releases we are experimenting with implementing smaller
net new features. In 3.0.9 the following new features were added:

* Associations can now define a ``bindingKey()`` this column allows you to bind
  associations to non-primary key columns. This aims to remove the need to
  define ``foreignKey => false`` in associations.
* Collections can now be serialized and unserialized with ease. This makes
  caching collections easier.
* Exception attributes are no longer logged when debug=0.
* ``Response::body()`` accepts a callable that can echo content directly or
  return the response body.
* ``Email::configuredTransport()`` was added to allow enumeration of the
  configured email transports.
* String templates accept ``.`` and ``_`` in variable names. This improves
  compatibility with arrays generated by ``Hash::flatten()``
* Custom Type classes can define a baseType that maps to a simpler type. This
  makes it easier for FormHelper to generate inputs for custom types.
* ``i18n extract`` now supports a ``--no-location`` option. This option will
  omit the location comments for messages from the generated POT file.

As always, a huge thanks to all the community members that helped make this
release happen by reporting issues and sending pull requests.
