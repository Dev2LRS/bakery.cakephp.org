CakePHP 2.7.0-RC Released
###################################

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
2.7.0-RC. 2.7.0 will be the next API compatible release for the 2.x release series.

2.7.0 should be a drop in replacement for your existing 2.5 or 2.6 libraries.
In 2.7 the following new features are available.

Deprecations
------------

- The class ``String`` has been renamed to ``CakeText``. This resolves some
  conflicts around HHVM compatibility as well as possibly PHP7+. There is
  a ``String`` class provided as well for compatibility reasons.
- ``Validation::notEmpty()`` has been renamed to ``Validation::notBlank()``.
  This aims to avoid confusion around the PHP ``notEmpty()`` function and that the
  validation rule accepts ``0`` as valid input.
- ``SessionComponent::setFlash()`` has been deprecated. You should use
  ``FlashComponent`` instead.
- ``SessionHelper::flash()`` has been deprecated. You should use
  ``FlashHelper`` instead.

Backported Features From 3.0
----------------------------

- Plugin shells that share a name with their plugin can now be called without
  the plugin prefix. For example ``Console/cake MyPlugin.my_plugin`` can now
  be called with ``Console/cake my_plugin``.
- ``Configure::consume()`` has been added to read and delete from
  Configure in a single step.
- ``CakeSession::consume()`` has been added to read and delete from
  session in a single step.
- New setting ``level`` is now available in ``TreeBehavior``. You can use it to
  specify field name in which the depth of tree nodes will be stored.
- New method ``TreeBehavior::getLevel()`` has been added which fetches depth of
  a node.
- ``SessionComponent::consume()`` has been added to read and delete
  from session in a single step.
- ``SessionHelper::consume()`` has been added to read and delete from
  session in a single step.

Other Improvements
------------------

- SQL datasources will now cast ``''`` and ``null`` into ``''`` when columns are
  not nullable and rows are being created or updated.
- Argument ``$renew`` has been added to ``CakeSession::clear()`` to allow
  emptying the session without forcing a new id and renewing the session. It
  defaults to ``true``.
- CakeEmail will now use the 'default' config set when creating instances that
  do not specify a configuration set to use. For example ``$email = new
  CakeEmail();`` will now use the 'default' config set.
- ``ControllerTestCase::testAction()`` now supports an array as URL.

If there are no major issues reported in the next 3-4 weeks, a stable release of
2.7.0 will be released.

As always, a huge thanks to all the community members that helped make this
release happen by reporting issues, writing documentation and sending pull requests.
