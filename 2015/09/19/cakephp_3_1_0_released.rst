* TODO

The `3.1 migration guide
<http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/appendices/3-1-migration-guide.html>`_ has
a full list of all the changes in 3.1.0 and is recommended reading for those
considering upgrading.

Upgrading your Application
--------------------------

You can use ``composer`` to upgrade from 3.0 to 3.1::

    php composer.phar require 'cakephp/cakephp:3.1.*'

This will install the new core libraries. You should then address any
deprecation warnings in your application, as deprecated features will be removed
in the future.

As always, a huge thanks to all the community members that helped make this
release happen by reporting issues and sending pull requests.
