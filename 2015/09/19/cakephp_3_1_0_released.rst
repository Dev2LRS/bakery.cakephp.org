CakePHP 3.1.0 Released
==========================

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
3.1.0. This release is an API stable release for 3.1. 3.1 delivers a number of
improvements to the 3.x release series.

New in 3.1
==========

ORM Enhancements
----------------

A big part of 3.1 was making the ORM even more awesome than it already is.

Lazy Eager Loading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now Lazily Eager Load Associations. This feature allows you to
conditionally load additional associations into a result set, entity or
collection of entities::

    $articles = $this->Articles->find('popular')->all();

    // Later on after some logic has run.
    // We can load additional associations.
    $withAuthors = $this->Articles->loadInto($articles, ['Authors']);

Additional Filtering Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may have already used ``matching()`` on the query object. In 3.1 you can
also use ``notMatching()`` to create a negated matching query::

    // Find articles with no comments.
    $query = $this->Articles->find('popular')
        ->notMatching('Comments');

You can use the ``leftJoinWith()`` and ``innerJoinWith()`` methods to join
associations without loading columns from those associations. This makes it easy
to do filtering on associations::

    $query = $this->Articles->find()
        ->innerJoinWith('Authors')
        ->where(['Authors.promoted' => true]);

Mailers
-------

Mailers allow you to create reusable emails throughout your application. They
can also be used to contain multiple email configurations in one location. This
helps keep your code DRYer and keeps email configuration noise out of other
areas in your application. See the `Mailer Documentation for more information
<http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/core-libraries/email.html#creating-reusable-emails>`_.

Additional Template Variables in Templates
-------------------------------------------

You can now add additional template placeholders in your application templates,
and then populate those placeholders when generating inputs::

    // Add a template with the help placeholder.
    $this->Form->templates([
        'inputContainer' => '<div class="input {{type}}{{required}}">
            {{content}} <span class="help">{{help}}</span></div>'
    ]);

    // Generate an input and populate the help variable
    echo $this->Form->input('password', [
        'templateVars' => ['help' => 'At least 8 characters long.']
    ]);

Shell Helpers
-------------

Shell Helpers let you easily package up complex output generation code. Shell
Helpers can be accessed and used from any shell or task::

    // Output some data as a table.
    $this->helper('table')->output($data);

    // Get a helper from a plugin.
    $this->helper('Plugin.HelperName')->output($data);

You can also get instances of helpers and call any public methods on them::

    // Get and use the Progress Helper.
    $progress = $this->helper('Progress');
    $progress->increment(10);
    $progress->draw();

CakePHP provides a Progress and Table helper that you can use to make your CLI
tools look better.

Refreshed Default Application Styles
------------------------------------

The styling used in the application skeleton have been streamlined and offer
improved rendering on smaller devices. In addition to cleaner visuals, bake
templates have been updated to create cleaner markup as well.

The above screenshot gives you a taste of what the new default styles look like.

Important Changes From 3.0
--------------------------

While none of the following changes modify method signatures, the behaviour of
specific methods is slightly different than in the past:

- ``FlashComponent`` now stacks Flash messages created with the ``set()``
  or ``__call()`` methods. This means that the structure in the Session for
  stored Flash messages has changed.
- New configuration option ``storage`` has been added. It contains the storage
  class name that ``AuthComponent`` uses to store user record. By default
  ``SessionStorage`` is used.  If using a stateless authenticator you should
  configure ``AuthComponent`` to use ``MemoryStorage`` instead.
- You can now also configure ``AuthComponent`` to do the auth check before
  controller's ``beforeFilter()`` callback is run using the ``checkAuthIn``
  configuration. This is particularly useful when using stateless authenticators.
- ``RequestHandlerComponent`` now switches the layout and template based on
  the parsed extension or ``Accept-Type`` header in the ``beforeRender()``
  callback instead of ``startup()`` callback.
- The default mime-type used when sending requests has changed in Http\Client.
  Previously ``multipart/form-data`` would always be used. In 3.1,
  ``multipart/form-data`` is only used when file uploads are present. When there
  are no file uploads, ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` is used.

Other Enhancements
------------------

- The default route class has been changed to ``DashedRoute`` in the
  ``cakephp/app`` repository. Your current code base is not affected by this,
  but it is recommended to use this route class from now on.
- The ``breakpoint()`` helper function has been added. This function provides
  a snippet of code that can be put into ``eval()`` to trigger an interactive
  console.
- ``Shell::dispatchShell()`` no longer outputs the welcome message from the
  dispatched shell.
- You can now set ``_serialized`` to ``true`` for ``JsonView`` and ``XmlView``
  to serialize all view variables instead of explicitly specifying them.
- ``Time::fromNow()`` has been added. This method makes it easier to calculate
  differences from 'now'.
- ``Time::i18nFormat()`` now supports non-gregorian calendars when formatting
  dates.
- ``Validation::latitude()``, and ``Validation::longitude()`` were added.
- ``Validation::ascii()``, ``Validation::utf8()``, and
  ``Validation::isInteger()`` were added.
- ``Cache::add()`` was ported from 2.x. This method allows you to atomically add
  data to a cache backend if the key did not already exist.
- ``Time::listTimezones()`` now supports options to display timezone
  abbreviations.
- ``Hash::get()`` now supports objects implementing ArrayAccess.
- ``Hash::sort()`` supports case-insensitive sorting through a new
  ``ignoreCase`` option.

Deprecations
------------

As we continue to improve CakePHP, certain features are deprecated as they are
replaced with better solutions. Deprecated features will not be removed until
4.0:

- The ``SessionHelper`` has been deprecated. You can use
  ``$this->request->session()`` directly.
- The following Controller properties are now deprecated:

  * layout
  * view
  * theme
  * autoLayout
  * viewPath
  * layoutPath

  Instead of setting these properties on your controllers, you should set them
  using the ViewBuilder.

The `3.1 migration guide
<http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/appendices/3-1-migration-guide.html>`_ has
a full list of all the changes in 3.1.0 and is recommended reading for those
considering upgrading.

Upgrading your Application
--------------------------

You can use ``composer`` to upgrade from 3.0 to 3.1::

    php composer.phar require 'cakephp/cakephp:3.1.*' 'cakephp/debug_kit:3.2.*' 'cakephp/bake:1.1.*'

This will install the new core libraries, update bake and DebugKit. You should
then address any deprecation warnings in your application, as deprecated
features will be removed in the future. If you are using the default CSS
provided with the application skeleton, you should also pull in the most recent
CSS in cakephp/app as the default styling and bake templates have been
refreshed.

As always, a huge thanks to all the community members that helped make this
release happen by reporting issues and sending pull requests.
