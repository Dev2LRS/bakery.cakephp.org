CakePHP 2.6.2 Released
======================

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the immediate availability
of CakePHP 2.6.2.

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the immediate availability
of CakePHP 2.6.2. 2.6.2 is a bugfix release for the 2.6 release
branch. A short list of the changes you can expect is:

+ Fixed exception rendering when ExceptionRenderer raised an error.
+ Notice errors in PaginatorHelper when no model was set have been
  fixed.
+ ConsoleOutput does not generate errors when used with
  `php://output`.
+ Redirect responses now use 302 as the default status code instead of
  200.
+ Plugin bake now generates correct directories for Views/Layouts.
+ FormHelper no longer creates invalid maxlength attributes for
  decimal columns when the text type is forced.
+ TextHelper no longer doubly links urls starting with //
+ POT file generation no longer includes the 'POT-Creation-Date'
  header. It often lead to pointless noise in version control.
