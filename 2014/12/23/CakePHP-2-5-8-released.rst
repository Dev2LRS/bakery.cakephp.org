CakePHP 2.5.8 released
======================

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the immediate availability
of CakePHP 2.5.8.

The CakePHP core team is proud to announce the immediate availability
of CakePHP 2.5.8. 2.5.8 is a bugfix release for the 2.5 release
branch. A short list of the changes you can expect is:

+ Improved error messages when fixtures are missing fields.
+ Human is now properly pluralized by Inflector
+ TreeBehavior regression introduced in 2.5.7 was fixed.
+ RequestHandler::startup() failures no longer prevent error pages
  from rendering. This could happen when custom input parsers were used.
+ Fixture baking will now ignore unconventional tables instead of
  stopping.
+ Importing schema from MySQL tables using timestamp columns now works
  better.

With the release of 2.6.0 complete, this will be the last release of
2.5.x barring any security related issues.
