The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability
of 2.4.9[1]. This releases contain a bug fix related to the security
fix in 2.4.8. A short list of changes you can expect in 2.4.9 are:

+ FormHelper::postLink() now works correctly with SecurityComponent.
  In 2.4.8 a mistake was made that resulted in incorrect hashes being
  generated.

If you use `postLink()` and have upgraded to 2.4.8 it is recommended
that you upgrade to 2.4.9 to avoid any potential issues. You can
download a packaged release from github[2].
